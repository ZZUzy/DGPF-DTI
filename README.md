# Decoupled Dual-Granularity Rebalanced Pyramid Network for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction
The Decoupling-based Dual-Granularity Rebalanced Pyramid Fusion Network provides a significant improvement in drug-target interaction prediction by addressing the molecular size discrepancies
between small drugs and large proteins. Our Decoupled Dual-Granularity Framework facilitates a deeper understanding of interactions at both macro and micro levels. The Rebalanced Pyramid Fusion Network effectively aggregates diverse modality features, maximizing their complementary strengths. Benchmark results confirm that DDGR-DTI outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, demonstrating robust generalization capabilities, particularly with unseen drugs and targets. This work represents a significant advancement in DTI prediction, providing a reliable tool for future drug discovery efforts.
